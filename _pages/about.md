Astronomy Master's Student
======

I am studying at the University of Western Ontario under Dr. Jan Cami with a focus on astrochemistry. My current research involves JWST studies of the planetary nebula Tc 1 to study large carbonaceous chains (fullerenes) and how they are affected by their environment. Previously, I worked as a post-baccalaureate researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying complex organic molecules in star-forming regions. I have experience working with high spatial and spectral resolution datasets using both JWST and interferometers such as the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
